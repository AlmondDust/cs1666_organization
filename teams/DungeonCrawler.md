## Game Description
A high fantasy hack and slash dungeon crawler with the ability to create parties and play with others PvE.  Dungeons will be procedurally generated mazes that increase in difficulty as the player goes deeper.  The layout will be floor based, and the players advance to the next floor by finding the stairs that are randomly placed somewhere on the map.  The end goal is to reach the bottom/top floor of the dungeon, which will be a "boss room" that will contain a difficult encounter, be it a lot of enemies or a specified boss.  From this the player will get high tier loot that they can then use to take on more difficult dungeons to get even better loot, and so on and so forth.  Loot is procedurally generated and will follow a common/rare/epic/legendary rank system.  Loot can drop randomly from defeated enemies as well as from chests that can be found scattered around the map.  Combat will follow a real time hack and slash format, with players using weapons/skills to deal damage to enemies.  Enemies will each have their own AI and behaviors, as well as a game master AI that will track what enemies are giving the players trouble, what they are doing well against, and dynamically adjust the enemy types, amounts, and locations to ensure a sufficiently difficult experience.
