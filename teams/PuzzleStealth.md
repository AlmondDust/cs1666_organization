## Game Description

A co-op puzzle stealth game where one player controls the "Agent" whose job it is to infiltrate a facility and the other player controls the "Hacker" whose job it is to 
hack into various systems in order to assist the Agent. 

The Agent's gameplay will focus on moving around a facility, avoiding or disposing of guards, physically interacting with the environment, giving the Hacker access to 
subsystems, etc.

The Hacker's gameplay will focus around a computer screen that will allow the hacker to see a simplified representation of the facility with icons to click on to access
certain systems such as cameras, doors, computers, security systems of various types, and other electronics. The Hacker's screen can also display documents that may
contain useful information, the location of guards (provided the Hacker has accessed the proper subsystem), and a window for puzzles.

Puzzles will be framed in the context of hacking/infiltrating. Some puzzles will only need to be solved by the Agent (i.e. lockpicking) and others only by the Hacker (i.e. password cracking).
Some puzzles will require the Agent and the Hacker to work together and exchange information in order to succeed.

Objectives for the team to complete will range from extracting VIPs, stealing sensitive information, assassinating a target, etc.
